- 👋 Hi, I’m @dorquiola
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge and skill set in programming languages. I love data visualization and primarily use Tableau, but would love to learn to utilize different software programs that may be better at analyzing and visualizing data depending on the needs and data source.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code and analyze data using R studio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me gain experience.
